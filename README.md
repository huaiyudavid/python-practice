# Practice Problems
## Familiarizing yourself with the Python environment
1. Create a program that prints the words "Hello World" to the terminal.
2. Create a program that reads a single value (either word or number) and prints it out.
3. Create a program that reads 3 values and prints them in the reverse order they were entered (e.g. an input of 4 5 6 should print "6 5 4").

## Using Expression and Operators
1. Write a program that accepts a number n as input (no need to clean the input) and prints the value of n+nn+nnn.
