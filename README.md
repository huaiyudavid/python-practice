# Practice Problems
__Guidelines:__
1. Try to solve the problem on your own, with no help.
2. If you need to, look at a couple hints for the problem.
3. If you solve it, compare your answer with mine. If you still can't solve it after hints, try understanding what I did in my solution.

__Note:__ Keep in mind that my answers are not necessarily the only way to implement these problems. Many problems have multiple solutions that are equally as correct and stylistically good. Of course, there are certain optimizations that can be made that set apart some solutions from others, but for now we are only worrying about correctness, so all solutions are correct. Also, in each section the problems generally increase in difficulty.
## Familiarizing yourself with the Python environment
1. Create a program that prints the words "Hello World" to the terminal.
2. Create a program that reads a single value (either word or number) and prints it out.
3. Create a program that reads 3 values and prints them in the reverse order they were entered (e.g. an input of 4 5 6 should print "6 5 4").
4. Create a program that reads a value from the user and prints the type of the value.

## Using Expressions and Operators
1. Write a program that reads 2 numbers from the user and prints out their sum.
2. Write a program that prints out the radius of a sphere, with the radius give by the user.
3. Write a program to find the average of 2 numbers inputted by the user.
4. Write a program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.
5. Write a program that accepts a number n as input (no need to clean the input) and prints the value of n+nn+nnn.
6. Write a program that reads 2 numbers from the user, a and b, and prints out a raised to the b power.
7. Write a program that reads 2 numbers from the user, x and y, and prints out the remainder of x/y.

## Conditionals and Control Flow
1. Write a program that reads 1 number from the user and prints out whether the number is even or odd (e.g. 2 should print out "even", 3 should print out "odd").
2. Write a program that reads 1 number n and prints "Hooray" if n is greater than 10, and "Darn it" otherwise.
3. Write a program to print the sum of two given integers. However, if the sum is between 15 to 20 it will print 20.

## Loops + Conditionals
1. Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 100 (do not hardcode this).
2. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6 (you may hardcode the 3 and 6 but use a loop to iterate from 0 to 6).
3. Write a program to print 30 "*" characters.
4. Write a program that reads a number n and prints that number n times (e.g. 3 would print "333").
5. Write a program that reads a number n and prints out all numbers greater than or equal to 2 and less than n that are divisible by 5 and 7.
6. Write a program that reads a number n and prints out all numbers greater than or equal to 2 and less than n that are divisible by 5 or 7.
7. Write a program that prints out the following pattern for any given n:
```
n=3
*
**
***

n=5
*
**
***
****
*****
```
8. Write a program that first reads a number n. Then read n number of numbers from the user, and calculate (and print) their average.
9. Write a program to calculate and print a dog's age in dog years, given the age of the dog in human years. Take the age as input. For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.

## Functions
1. Write a function that calculates and returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given the two other side lengths as parameters. Then call this function with lengths 5 and 12.
2. Write a function that takes in a string as a parameter, representing the name of a person. The function should return the given name with the word "san" appended to the end (e.g. "Smith" turns into "Smithsan"). Then call this function once with the name "David" and another time with the name "Charles".

## Lists
1. Write a program that reads an integer n from the user and removes the element at index n from the hardcoded list [34, 5, 68, 2456, 245, 47, 23, 4, 2, 9, 45]. Print the resulting list.
2. Write a program that reads an integer n from the user and removes the first element equivalent to n from the hardcoded list [34, 5, 68, 2456, 245, 47, 23, 4, 2, 9, 45]. If n is not in the list, it should do nothing. Print the resulting list.
3. Write a program that reads an integer n from the user first. The program should then read in n more numbers and add those numbers to a list. Print the resulting list.

## Challenge
1. Write a function that takes in a list l and target t and finds the second occurrence of t in l. If t does not occur at least twice, return -1. Otherwise, return the index of the second occurrence.
2. Write a function that takes in a list l of numbers and returns a new list where the number at index i is the sum of the number at index i in l
