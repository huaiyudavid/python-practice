# Practice Problems
## Familiarizing yourself with the Python environment
1. Create a program that prints the words "Hello World" to the terminal.
2. Create a program that reads a single value (either word or number) and prints it out.
3. Create a program that reads 3 values and prints them in the reverse order they were entered (e.g. an input of 4 5 6 should print "6 5 4").

## Using Expressions and Operators
1. Write a program that reads 2 numbers from the user and prints out their sum.
2. Write a program that prints out the radius of a sphere, with the radius give by the user.
3. Write a program to find the average of 2 numbers inputted by the user.
4. Write a program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.
5. Write a program that accepts a number n as input (no need to clean the input) and prints the value of n+nn+nnn.
6. Write a program that reads 2 numbers from the user, a and b, and prints out a raised to the b power.
7. Write a program that reads 2 numbers from the user, x and y, and prints out the remainder of x/y.

## Conditionals and Control Flow
1. Write a program that reads 1 number from the user and prints out whether the number is even or odd (e.g. 2 should print out "even", 3 should print out "odd").
2.
